# Configuration

The following macros are used for configuring your site's repo, as well as a few general settings. These macros are located in the script `tomeConfig`.

## Macros

| Macro Name                       | Purpose                                                                                                                                    |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `TOME_ENABLED`                   | Whether or not to enable the system to run when your project is ran.                                                                       |
| `TOME_SETUP_SCRIPT_FILE`         | The resource file that contains your `tomeSetup` function declaration. This is used for clearer debugging and is not required. By default this is set to "tomeDocsSetup" and only needs changed if you move your `tomeSetup` declaration to another file. |
| `TOME_LOCAL_REPO_PATH`           | This is the path to the local repo used for your site. When running in CI, this can be overridden at runtime using the `TOME_OUTPUT_PATH` environment variable. |
| `TOME_VERBOSE`                   | Show extended debug information in the console                                                                                             |
| `TOME_METHOD_GROUP_DEPTH`        | The header depth that method groups are displayed at when rendered in HTML. See information below about `TOME_METHOD_GROUP_DEPTH_HEADER` |
| `TOME_DISPLAY_TYPE_IN_BRACKETS`  | Controls if the generated markdown wraps types in curly brackets. If set to true types will be displayed as `{type}`, if false they will be displayed as `type` |
