# Setting Up Tome

?> This guide assumes you know the basics of how Github repos work

## Setting up Tome in your project
1) Download the [latest version](https://github.com/chesrowe/Tome/releases) of Tome and import the `.yymps` file into your project.
2) Clone the Github repo you want to use for your site locally.
3) In your project, navigate to the script `tomeConfig` and set the macro `TOME_LOCAL_REPO_PATH` to the path of your locally cloned Github repo.
4) Add your script and note files as well as any site customization in the tomeSetup function declaration found in the tomeDocSetup file.

?> Note: You must disable GameMaker's sandbox (Game Options -> Platform -> Check "Disable file system sandbox") for Tome to properly execute.

## Setting up GitHub Pages
Next we'll configure Github pages to deploy your site. Unless you are using a custom domain, your site's domain will be `username.github.io/repoName`.

1. on [GitHub.com](https://www.github.com), find your repo and click **settings**

4. After saving, and several minutes have passed, you should see at the top of the page that your site is live!
