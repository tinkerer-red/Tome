# Setting Up Your Site



Setting up your documentation site is relatively simple. All of your code will be written in the function `tomeSetup`.

By default this is located in the included asset tomeDocSetup. This can be moved to a location of your choosing. Check out [this](api-reference-primary-functions) for more information.

## Example
Here is an example of how the site for Tome is set up.

```gml
// Place all of your Tome.site.* function calls inside of this function. 
function tomeSetup(){
    /*/
     * Set your site info here!
    /*/
    
    Tome.site.setName("Tome");
    
    Tome.site.setDescription("Documentation for the Tome library"); 
    Tome.site.setLatestVersion("1.0.0"); 
    Tome.site.setOlderVersions(["0.5.0", "0.4.0", "0.3.0", "0.2.0", "0.1.0"]);
    
    /*/
     * Set any theme data here!
     * Check out the tome docs as there is so much more that can be customized now.
    /*/ 
    
    Tome.site.setThemeColor("#11DD11");
    
    /*/
     * Add files and links you wish to make up the docs page sidebar here!
    /*/	
    
    Tome.site.setHomepage("nte_homepage");
    
     
    Tome.site.add("__tome"); 
    Tome.site.addRaw("nte_configuration", "Configuration", "API Reference");
    
    Tome.site.addRaw("nte_settingUp", "Setting Up Tome", "Getting Started"); 
    Tome.site.addRaw("nte_exampleSite", "Setting Up Your Site", "Getting Started"); 
    
    Tome.site.add("nte_formattingScripts", "nte_slugs"); 
    Tome.site.addRaw("nte_advancedUse", "Advanced Use", "Misc");
    
    /*/
     * Add any information you want added to the navbar here!
    /*/ 
    
    Tome.site.addNavbarLink("https://github.com/CataclysmicStudios/Tome/issues", "Report a bug"); 
    Tome.site.addNavbarLink("https://github.com/CataclysmicStudios/Tome/releases", "Releases");
     
}
```

## Breakdown
?> The order in which you call these functions does not matter, this is just how I've arranged them.

- `Tome.site.add()` points to a script, note, or external file that we have setup with at least the `@title` and `@category` tag.
- `Tome.site.addRaw()` points to a note or external file that only contains markdown. This markdown is added to the site as is.
- `Tome.site.setHomepage()` Sets what your site's homepage will be, and is required!
- `Tome.site.setName()` Sets what name will displayed in your browser's tab
- `Tome.site.setLatestVersion()` Sets the latest version, which will be the default verson of your docs that will be shown when the site is loaded, changing this will add a new version in the version selecter and the older versions will stay unchanged as they were before this was changed.
- `Tome.site.setThemeColor()` Sets the accent color of your site(More custimization options are planned for the future.)
